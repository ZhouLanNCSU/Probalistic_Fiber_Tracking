# Probalistic_Fiber_Tracking

This github repository contains the codes for the manuscript "Probabilistic Diffusion MRI Fiber Tracking Using a Directed Acyclic Graph Auto-Regressive Model of Positive Definite Matrices".

#### "Real_Data_Analysis"
1. The folder contains all the scripts used for Section 3.
2. The script "real_data.R" is used to carry out the real data analysis implementing our proposal.

#### "Numerical_Studies"
1. The folder contains all the scripts used for Section 4.
2. "SpDist_LS_XX.R" carry out simulation studies of BOTH SpDist (our proposal) and least sqaures (LS) with noise standard error XX
3. "Dist.R" carry out simulation studies of Dist with noise standard error XX
4. The folder "DATA_SCRIPTS" contains required datasets/script for implementing the above simulation scripts.
